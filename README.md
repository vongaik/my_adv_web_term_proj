# üé¨ My Movie Finder App

A responsive single-page web application that lets users **search, browse, and explore movies and actors** using live data from *The Movie Database (TMDb) API*. The app dynamically fetches and displays content without page reloads ‚Äî offering a fast, interactive, and modern movie discovery experience.

- **Real-Time Movie Search:** Search movies by keywords using TMDb‚Äôs `/search/movie` REST endpoint.
- **Popular Movies View:** Fetches trending titles via `/movie/popular` and dynamically renders results.
- **Dynamic Actor Details:** Click on any actor to expand and view detailed info (biography, job title, etc.) from the `/person/{id}` endpoint.
- **Multiple Display Modes:** Switch between grid and list views with seamless layout toggling.
- **Pagination:** Results include fully functional pagination that updates dynamically based on API results.
- **Interactive UI:** Built with Mustache.js templates and jQuery to render API responses instantly.
- **Error Handling & UX Enhancements:** Gracefully handles missing data and enhances readability and user flow.
